      <p>
        I am a developer who recently finished Lambda School - a full-time, 6+
        month intensive coding academy. I love Technology. When I'm not geeking
        on Tech, I might be cooking, playing basketball or sleeping.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know everybody who applies for a role says they're huge fans, but I am
        100% an EightSleep fan boy. No, seriously.
      </p>

      <div className="h-1/2 flex flex-wrap justify-center">
        {imgs.map((photo) => (
          <Img src={photo.src} fallback={photo.fallback} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </Div>
